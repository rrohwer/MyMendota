shiny-making notes:

# The shiny UI is a bunch of nested functions. confusing b/c argument flags not included
# need commas between arguments, so commas going after function calls b/c they're arguments of a parent function
# the other confusing thing is that the parentheses don't automatically go to the text edge they're closing like function {}'s do

# shinyUI() makes everything inside it an html script
  # fluidPage() describes how the html script handles display as window size changes (maybe?)
    # titlePanel() makes a title panel print at the top of the page
    # sidebarLayout makes a page layout below the title that includes a side and main panel
      # sidebarPanel fills the side panel
        # selectInput makes a dropdown menu 
      # main Panel fills the main panel
        # plotOutput makes the plot show up



# shinyServer() All of this stuff is done each time a user visits the app (above it run only when app launched)
# defines a function that's run based on input and output arguments
  # it requires input (all variable from the UI)
  # and output (all variable sent to the UI)
# could outputs that are independent of input go above the shinyServer() call?
# why does renderPlot({}) use both parentheses and curly brackets??




clear env before run app, otherwise can "cheat" with local variables that server won't have

debugging is a pain in the butt
since you can't step through line by line like running in RStudio,
have to debug like a script you source from the teminal- add cat() after every line!
ex: points not showing up, cat str() all the input and it was character
